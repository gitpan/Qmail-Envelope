=head1 NAME

Qmail::Envelope - Perl module modifying qmail envelope strings.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Qmail::Envelope;

  ## When you have received the envelope from qmail-smtpd
  my $E = Qmail::Envelope->new (data => $Envelope);

  ## or if you want to create one on the fly ...
  my $E = Qmail::Envelope->new();

  ## add a recipient
  $E->add_recip('foo@bar.com');

  ## remove a recipient
  $E->remove_recip('foo@ack.com');

  ## remove all recipients for a specific domain
  $E->remove_recips_for_host('quux.com');

  ## clear the entire recipient list
  $E->remove_all_recips;

  ## get ref to an array containing the list of hosts in the envelope
  my $host_list = $E->rcpt_hosts;

  ## get envelope sender
  my $sender = $E->sender;

  ## get the total number of recipients in the envelope.
  ## duplicates are counted.
  my $number_of_recips = $E->total_recips;

  ## get the total numbers of recips for a specific host
  my $number_of_recips = $E->total_recips_for_host('frobnicate.com');

  ## remove duplicate recipient entries in the envelope
  $E->remove_duplicate_recips;

  ## pretty print the envelope
  print $E->as_string;

  ## complete formatted envelope, with terminating null bytes and all.
  my $envelope = $E->gen;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module takes a qmail envelope, and allows you perform
operations on it. You can also create qmail envelopes from
scratch.  A quick background: qmail-smtpd hands all mail messages
it receives to the mail queuer program, qmail-queue.  qmail-queue
gets the message (headers and body) from qmail-smtpd on file
descriptor 1, and the envelope on file descriptor 2.  Yeah, I
thought it was weird at first too.

Anyway, the envelope is a string which contains the sender and all of
the recipients of a mail message.  This envelope may or may not
match the headers of the mail message (think cc and bcc).  The envelope
tells qmail-queue where the message is from, and where it is going
to.  As far as I can tell, qmail-queue does not read the headers
of the mail message at all.

This module my help you if you have decided to insert a perl script
in between qmail-smtpd and qmail-queue.  There is an interesting open
source program called qmail-scanner which (in its documentation) explains
how to accomplish this this neat trick.

I hope this module helps someone out there.  I've been using it in a
production environment for some time now, and it seems stable.


=head2 EXPORT

None by default.


=head1 SEE ALSO

Useful to me was qmail-scanner program, located at:
http://qmail-scanner.sourceforge.net/

Also helpful were the man pages for qmail-smtpd, qmail-queue,
and envelopes.  They all come with the qmail mail server source.
